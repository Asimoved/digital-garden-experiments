But there is often much more to a word than what we know on the surface level.Human language is said to be 'messy' and ambiguous, context dependent, and not nearly as 'precise' as a formal language, like a programming language. The conversation with a friend, or this page will not crash if I make a semantic (meaning) or syntax (grammatical) error. Still, a lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word.

But being aware can provide a powerful framework.Disclaimer: this 'list' will change massively as we go on, as the new things we learn and discover using these guiding principles will recursively change the process itself. The list here will have the TLDR version with more details in the full articles.As a first, self recursive guiding principle let's have:
<a data-href="Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding principles you have" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding principles you have</a>
We have used words, English words to articulate, note and document this first guiding principle. If the words make sense to you, good, it means we made an intelligible sentence. Words and writing are a very very powerful tool.
<br><a data-href="Inspect your base assumptions" href="guiding-principles/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Inspect your base assumptions</a>
We are not starting everything from 0, all the time. Whatever we do, whenever we communicate we make a number (innumerable) assumptions. This has an important function to keep things efficient, but there can be disadvantages, and in this case serious ones. But what exactly does the word mean?
<br><a data-href="Study the meaning of the words" href="guiding-principles/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Study the meaning of the words</a>
A lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word. The Contexts it is used in, it's Relateds, Synonyms, etc., it's Etymology (origin) can reveal new aspects and insights that will make thinking and documentation more effective and precise.]]></description><link>guiding-principles.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">guiding principles.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:01:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inspect your base assumptions]]></title><link>guiding-principles/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">guiding principles/Inspect your base assumptions.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:55:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[welcome]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome to my mind garden.

From Latin eruditio&nbsp;("an instructing, learning, erudition"), from erudire&nbsp;("to instruct, educate, cultivate", literally "free from rudeness"), from e&nbsp;("out") + rudis&nbsp;("rude").The word "erudition" comes from the Latin eruditio, meaning "learning," which is a noun from the verb erudire, meaning "to instruct" or "to educate". This Latin verb is a compound of e- ("out") and rudis ("rude," "unskilled," or "rough"), so erudire literally meant "to free from rudeness". Therefore, erudition is the result of being "taken out of a rough or uncultivated state" through a process of education and learning.&nbsp;
Latin roots: erudire = e- ("out") + rudis ("rough," "unskilled").
Literal meaning: "To free from rudeness" or "to remove coarseness".
Figurative meaning: The process of educating or instructing someone, leading them from a state of being "rough" or unlearned to one of polished and extensive knowledge.
Modern usage: The noun "erudition" refers to the deep, scholarly knowledge that results from this process.
