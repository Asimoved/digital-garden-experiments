Old English wilcuma ‘a person whose coming is pleasing’, wilcumian (verb), from wil- ‘desire, pleasure’ + cuman ‘come’. The first element was later changed to wel- ‘well’, influenced by Old French bien venu or Old Norse velkominn . Received with pleasure and hospitality into one's company or home.

because I believe these ways of seeing the World are more correct, and will supersede the current, predominantly mechanistic worldview realizing The Glass Bead Game (described in Hermann Hesse's book of the same name), because in my interpretation, conception, it would be one of the highest forms of Communication, Understanding, Art and honestly it would be a super fun to experience. I believe there may be People who suffer, because this instrument has not yet been created and therefore cannot express themselves to the highest degree (just imagine, if the piano was not there in the time of Mozart)

<br>Some of my <a data-href="beliefs" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">beliefs</a> (I guess my base assumptions, in a way):
When I read Christopher Alexander's The Nature of Order, I had a worldview shift, and since then I completely ascribe to the view, that every part of space has a degree of Life (as opposed to segregating 'living' and 'dead' things) and Wholeness (aka. Health) and that it is our duty and responsibility to learn how this structure emerges in Nature so that we can be an extension of Structure Preserving Process, the Structure Enhancing Process.
I believe the process of Nature is to create Beauty and the accompanying Consciousness to experience it. Learning is the process that 'facilitates' this. It is the way for Nature to Sense itself. Does it make sense? <br>Some <a data-href="questions" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">questions</a> I ask myself (very high level):

<a data-href="method" href="words/method.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">method</a>
/ˈmɛθəd/
noun
Origin: late Middle English (in the sense ‘prescribed medical treatment for a disease’): via Latin from Greek methodos ‘pursuit of knowledge’, from meta- (expressing development) + hodos ‘way’.
Definitions: a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.
the quality of being well organized and systematic in thought or action Disclaimer: this 'list' will change massively as we go on, as the new things we learn and discover using these guiding methods will recursively change the process itself. The list here will have the TLDR version with more details in the full articles.Doubts, Issues <br>Even though I read up on it and have the page <a data-href="technique vs. method" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">technique vs. method</a>, I am still debating whether to call these methods or techniques, but for now I do not want to get bogged down. I will just dump everything here and specify, disambiguate later as needed. I am listing, documenting these methods and techniques here to serve as reference and as a growing framework for thinking and analysis to progress the ideas.As a first, self recursive guiding method let's have:
<br><a data-href="Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have</a>
We have used words, English words to articulate, note and document this first guiding principle. If the words make sense to you, good, it means we made an intelligible sentence. Words and writing are a very very powerful tool.
<br><a data-href="Inspect your base assumptions" href="guides/guiding-methods/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Inspect your base assumptions</a>
<br>We are not starting everything from 0, all the time. Whatever we do, whenever we communicate we make a number (innumerable) assumptions. This has an important function to keep things efficient, but there can be disadvantages, and in this case serious ones. But what exactly does the word, <a data-href="assumption" href="words/assumption.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">assumption</a> mean?
<br><a data-href="Study the meaning of the words" href="guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Study the meaning of the words</a>
A lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word. The Contexts it is used in, it's Relateds, Synonyms, etc., it's Etymology (origin) can reveal new aspects and insights that will make thinking and documentation more effective and precise.
<br><a data-href="Make the methods actionable" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make the methods actionable</a>
They are useful as text, but they will come alive as code. To keep in mind the guiding principles, methods, set up reminders and other mechanisms, make them as built in, integrated as possible.Of course this has to be elaborated much more to become robust. But let's start by defining some words that we have used so far.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="words/index" data-href="words/index" href="words/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">index</a><br>
<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="words/welcome" data-href="words/welcome" href="words/welcome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">welcome</a><br>
<a data-href="guide" href="words/guide.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">guide</a><br>
<a data-href="assume" href="words/assume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">assume</a><br>
<a data-href="assumption" href="words/assumption.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">assumption</a>
Acceptance: Accept that you don't know what this is, you do not know the shape of the 'problem' and maybe you never will
Actionable: think about and implement things as code, action, etc. so they are not dead and static, but alive, dynamic and part of the stream and fabric of Life.
Analysis, Elements: Keep track of that are the element, constituents of the systems at play, in use, and see what kinds of fields they generate. For example the words, sentences in text, the colors of an image, etc.
Asimov: be as clear and precise as possible. It is not easy, and people underestimate this.
Base Assumptions: take a step back, zoom out, be honest and try to articulate what your base assumptions are
Change of Scenery, Environment
Compare Entities: <br>For example to properly name and categorize, besides the <a data-href="Dictionary definition" href="guides/guiding-methods/dictionary-definition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dictionary definition</a> method, also compare the words and terms. for example: <a data-href="technique vs. method" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">technique vs. method</a> Consilience: everything should be connected and the traversal should be natural
Continuous Improvement
Creative language, symbols: just like how locals and natives name different plants and animals based on some traits, so that the names themselves contain these traits, we should not be afraid to invent words, language to define specific Centers, Concepts in order to build new tools for thinking, and to avoid the confusion (conflation?) with existing concepts in the mental landscape/mindscape.
Dictionary Definition: Study the meaning, origin, etymology and relateds of words you use.
Doubt, Question, Skepticism: it does not cost you anything to ask questions, have doubts and take skeptical positions.
Environment: inspirational (books, things), comfort, relaxed?, lighting, which room, nature, peace, quiet, no possibility for interruption
Examples: Always provide examples, especially for abstractions, abstract descriptions. It can be really painful when there is an elaborate description, but even just one well placed example could illuminate
Free Association: aka Braindump, just release your train of thought.
Guiding Principles: contemplate what foundations motivate you
Holistic approach: not only the product is important but all aspects around it in all dimensions and directions (like this list itself)
Itadakimasu: Japanese be thankful, grateful for the resources, food, energy you use, consume, which passes through you, keeps you alive
Journey over Destination: there is nothing wrong with getting to the destination, but make sure it does not damage the experience of getting there.
Kanban: Japanese Learn from History: at least learn that we don't learn from it!
Lifecycle: everything has a lifecycle, so it is a common pattern that can help with analyzing, understanding, learning
Manage the Methods: I don't like the word 'manage', but it best encapsulates the creation, maintenance, cleanup, etc. add new methods when you do something that is not on this list if there is any chance that it is not a one off thing (and even then it might be valuable) Meditation: calm, compose yourself, re-center
Metaphors
Mindset: should try to achieve, strive for the appropriate mindset that best first your current activity, creative, production, inspiration
Mind your Balance
Minimalism: be conservative with space and energy (for ease of maintenance, storage, access, complexity, utility)
Mottainai: Japanese Multi-media, multi-view: why not provide all functions, views, representations for everything?
Natural abilities: Tap into the natural abilities of the Person
Nutrition: use different states of nutrition (hunger and fasting are not bad)
Organization: better organized, for easier access, manipulation, transformation, communication, storage, backup
Origin: study the origin and etymology of things, words, names, concepts, people, etc.
Pattern Break: Mix it up sometimes
Preservation: constant backup, preservation, conservation
**Pros and Cons
Random: take a chance sometimes, random page, random note, etc.
Review: the relation of everything to everything Rewatch, re-read, etc. periodically, you might learn, find something new, see things in a new, different, better light Save for later: Keep things that you do not understand yet, but feel, have an intuition that will be important or valuable, and might come back to in the future
<br>Self-Recursion, Self Reference: Check if self recursion is in any way applicable to what you are doing. For example check the definition of the word: <a data-href="word" href="words/word.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">word</a> What other examples and sub-methods, sub-techniques? learning about learning
notes about notes
trash the trashcan The possibilities are almost endless Stepwise elaboration, levels of scale: all representations should be gradual, zooming in-out should be natural (like this point itself)
Subconscious: let your mind work on it in the background while you use your consciousness, focus and attention for more immediate matters
Switch points of view, perspectives: try as many as you can, contemplate and compare them, understand the differences

Try different structures: cyclical, linear, tree, branching, networked
Unfolding: everything should be foldable stepwise, in a natural beautiful way (like Origami), from one point, to complete multidimensional, explorable space
Use Colors
Use Language
Use your circumstances: lean into your gifts, abilities, genetics, knowledge, power, wealth, etc.
Version control: know where you left off, see the evolution, try forks Video, Text, Transcript, Audio, Presentation, etc. ]]></description><link>guides/guiding-methods-and-techniques.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">guides/guiding methods and techniques.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:51:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How do we learn？]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dictionary

The conversation with a friend, or this page will not crash if I make a semantic (meaning) or syntax (grammatical) error. Still, a lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word.

morally correct behaviour and attitudes.
a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behaviour or for a chain of reasoning.
a fundamental source or basis of something. a fundamental quality determining the nature of something. A guiding principle is a fundamental, core belief or value that directs an individual's or organization's decisions, behaviors, and actions. These principles serve as an internal compass, providing a framework for consistency, ethics, and strategic direction regardless of changing circumstances.
Behind every action, activity, there seems to be a guiding principle, process, a source, even if we don't realize or cannot articulate them.

noun Deep, extensive learning. synonym: knowledge.
Learning; scholarship; knowledge gained by study or from books and instruction; particularly, learning in literature, history, antiquities, and languages, as distinct from knowledge of the mathematical and physical sciences.
The act of instructing; the result of thorough instruction; the state of being erudite or learned; the acquisitions gained by extensive reading or study; particularly, learning in literature or criticism, as distinct from the sciences; scholarship.
Profound knowledge, especially that based on learning and scholarship. From Latin eruditio&nbsp;("an instructing, learning, erudition"), from erudire&nbsp;("to instruct, educate, cultivate", literally "free from rudeness"), from e&nbsp;("out") + rudis&nbsp;("rude").The word "erudition" comes from the Latin eruditio, meaning "learning," which is a noun from the verb erudire, meaning "to instruct" or "to educate". This Latin verb is a compound of e- ("out") and rudis ("rude," "unskilled," or "rough"), so erudire literally meant "to free from rudeness". Therefore, erudition is the result of being "taken out of a rough or uncultivated state" through a process of education and learning.&nbsp;
Latin roots: erudire = e- ("out") + rudis ("rough," "unskilled").
Literal meaning: "To free from rudeness" or "to remove coarseness".
Figurative meaning: The process of educating or instructing someone, leading them from a state of being "rough" or unlearned to one of polished and extensive knowledge.
Modern usage: The noun "erudition" refers to the deep, scholarly knowledge that results from this process.

<a data-href="method" href="words/method.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">method</a>
/ˈmɛθəd/
noun
Origin: late Middle English (in the sense ‘prescribed medical treatment for a disease’): via Latin from Greek methodos ‘pursuit of knowledge’, from meta- (expressing development) + hodos ‘way’.
Definitions: a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.
the quality of being well organized and systematic in thought or action Disclaimer: this 'list' will change massively as we go on, as the new things we learn and discover using these guiding methods will recursively change the process itself. The list here will have the TLDR version with more details in the full articles.As a first, self recursive guiding method let's have:
<br><a data-href="Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have</a>
We have used words, English words to articulate, note and document this first guiding principle. If the words make sense to you, good, it means we made an intelligible sentence. Words and writing are a very very powerful tool.
<br><a data-href="Inspect your base assumptions" href="guides/guiding-methods/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Inspect your base assumptions</a>
<br>We are not starting everything from 0, all the time. Whatever we do, whenever we communicate we make a number (innumerable) assumptions. This has an important function to keep things efficient, but there can be disadvantages, and in this case serious ones. But what exactly does the word, <a data-href="assumption" href="words/assumption.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">assumption</a> mean?
<br><a data-href="Study the meaning of the words" href="guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Study the meaning of the words</a>
A lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word. The Contexts it is used in, it's Relateds, Synonyms, etc., it's Etymology (origin) can reveal new aspects and insights that will make thinking and documentation more effective and precise.
<br><a data-href="Make the methods actionable" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make the methods actionable</a>
They are useful as text, but they will come alive as code. To keep in mind the guiding principles, methods, set up reminders and other mechanisms, make them as built in, integrated as possible.Of course this has to be elaborated much more to become robust. But let's start by defining some words that we have used so far.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="words/index" data-href="words/index" href="words/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">index</a><br>

Acceptance: Accept that you don't know what this is, you do not know the shape of the 'problem' and maybe you never will
Actionable: think about and implement things as code, action, etc. so they are not dead and static, but alive, dynamic and part of the stream and fabric of Life.
Analysis, Elements: Keep track of that are the element, constituents of the systems at play, in use, and see what kinds of fields they generate. For example the words, sentences in text, the colors of an image, etc.
Asimov: be as clear and precise as possible. It is not easy, and people underestimate this.
Base Assumptions: take a step back, zoom out, be honest and try to articulate what your base assumptions are
Change of Scenery, Environment
Consilience: everything should be connected and the traversal should be natural
Continuous Improvement
Creative language, symbols: just like how locals and natives name different plants and animals based on some traits, so that the names themselves contain these traits, we should not be afraid to invent words, language to define specific Centers, Concepts in order to build new tools for thinking, and to avoid the confusion (conflation?) with existing concepts in the mental landscape/mindscape.
Doubt, Question, Skepticism: it does not cost you anything to ask questions, have doubts and take skeptical positions.
Environment: inspirational (books, things), comfort, relaxed?, lighting, which room, nature, peace, quiet, no possibility for interruption
Guiding Principles: contemplate what foundations motivate you
Holistic approach: not only the product is important but all aspects around it in all dimensions and directions (like this list itself)
Itadakimasu: Japanese be thankful, grateful for the resources, food, energy you use, consume, which passes through you, keeps you alive
Journey over Destination
Kanban: Japanese Learn from History: at least learn that we don't learn from it!
Lifecycle: everything has a lifecycle, so it is a common pattern that can help with analyzing, understanding, learning
Meditation: calm, compose yourself, re-center
Metaphors
Mindset: should try to achieve, strive for the appropriate mindset that best first your current activity, creative, production, inspiration
Mind your Balance
Minimalism: be conservative with space and energy (for ease of maintenance, storage, access, complexity, utility)
Mottainai: Japanese Multi-media, multi-view: why not provide all functions, views, representations for everything?
Natural abilities: Tap into the natural abilities of the Person
Nutrition: use different states of nutrition (hunger and fasting are not bad)
Organization: better organized, for easier access, manipulation, transformation, communication, storage, backup
Origin: study the origin and etymology of things, words, names, concepts, people, etc.
Pattern Break: Mix it up sometimes
Preservation: constant backup, preservation, conservation
**Pros and Cons
Random: take a chance sometimes
Review: the relation of everything to everything Rewatch, re-read, etc. periodically, you might learn, find something new, see things in a new, different, better light Save for later: Keep things that you do not understand yet, but feel, have an intuition that will be important or valuable, and might come back to in the future
Stepwise elaboration, levels of scale: all representations should be gradual, zooming in-out should be natural (like this point itself)
Subconscious: let your mind work on it in the background while you use your consciousness, focus and attention for more immediate matters
Switch points of view, perspectives: try as many as you can, contemplate and compare them, understand the differences
Try different structures: cyclical, linear, tree, branching, networked
Unfolding: everything should be foldable stepwise, in a natural beautiful way (like Origami), from one point, to complete multidimensional, explorable space
Use Colors
Use Language
Use your circumstances: lean into your gifts, abilities, genetics, knowledge, power, wealth, etc.
Version control: know where you left off, see the evolution, try forks Video, Text, Transcript, Audio, Presentation, etc. ]]></description><link>guides/guiding-methods.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">guides/guiding methods.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:28:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[guiding principles]]></title><description><![CDATA[
A guiding principle is a fundamental, core belief or value that directs an individual's or organization's decisions, behaviors, and actions. These principles serve as an internal compass, providing a framework for consistency, ethics, and strategic direction regardless of changing circumstances.
Behind every action, activity, there seems to be a guiding principle or process, even if we don't realize or cannot articulate them. But being aware can provide a powerful framework.Disclaimer: this 'list' will change massively as we go on, as the new things we learn and discover using these guiding principles will recursively change the process itself.

But there is often much more to a word than what we know on the surface level.Human language is said to be 'messy' and ambiguous, context dependent, and not nearly as 'precise' as a formal language, like a programming language. The conversation with a friend, or this page will not crash if I make a semantic (meaning) or syntax (grammatical) error. Still, a lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word.
