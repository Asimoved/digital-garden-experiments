But there is often much more to a word than what we know on the surface level.Human language is said to be 'messy' and ambiguous, context dependent, and not nearly as 'precise' as a formal language, like a programming language. The conversation with a friend, or this page will not crash if I make a semantic (meaning) or syntax (grammatical) error. Still, a lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word. A lot of words have their original roots in Latin and Greek.Studying these aspects of the words can provide new, useful insights, improve our mastery of them, etc.<a data-href=\"list the keywords\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">list the keywords</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://www.wordnik.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://www.wordnik.com\" target=\"_self\">www.wordnik.com</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Related methods","level":1,"id":"Related_methods_0"},{"heading":"Tools","level":1,"id":"Tools_0"}],"links":[".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770246085526,"modifiedTime":1770301273354,"sourceSize":762,"sourcePath":"guides/guiding methods/Study the meaning of the words.md","exportPath":"guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":["index.html","guides/guiding-methods.html"],"type":"markdown"},"guides/guiding-methods.html":{"title":"guiding methods","icon":"","description":"\n<a data-href=\"method\" href=\"words/method.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">method</a>\n/ˈmɛθəd/\nnoun\nOrigin: late Middle English (in the sense ‘prescribed medical treatment for a disease’): via Latin from Greek methodos ‘pursuit of knowledge’, from meta- (expressing development) + hodos ‘way’.\nDefinitions: a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.\nthe quality of being well organized and systematic in thought or action Disclaimer: this 'list' will change massively as we go on, as the new things we learn and discover using these guiding methods will recursively change the process itself. The list here will have the TLDR version with more details in the full articles.As a first, self recursive guiding method let's have:\n<br><a data-href=\"Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have</a>\nWe have used words, English words to articulate, note and document this first guiding principle. If the words make sense to you, good, it means we made an intelligible sentence. Words and writing are a very very powerful tool.\n<br><a data-href=\"Inspect your base assumptions\" href=\"guides/guiding-methods/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Inspect your base assumptions</a>\n<br>We are not starting everything from 0, all the time. Whatever we do, whenever we communicate we make a number (innumerable) assumptions. This has an important function to keep things efficient, but there can be disadvantages, and in this case serious ones. But what exactly does the word, <a data-href=\"assumption\" href=\"words/assumption.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assumption</a> mean?\n<br><a data-href=\"Study the meaning of the words\" href=\"guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Study the meaning of the words</a>\nA lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word. The Contexts it is used in, it's Relateds, Synonyms, etc., it's Etymology (origin) can reveal new aspects and insights that will make thinking and documentation more effective and precise.\n<br><a data-href=\"Make the methods actionable\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Make the methods actionable</a>\nThey are useful as text, but they will come alive as code. To keep in mind the guiding principles, methods, set up reminders and other mechanisms, make them as built in, integrated as possible.Of course this has to be elaborated much more to become robust. But let's start by defining some words that we have used so far.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"words/index\" data-href=\"words/index\" href=\"words/index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">index</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"words/welcome\" data-href=\"words/welcome\" href=\"words/welcome.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">welcome</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"guide\" href=\"words/guide.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">guide</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"assume\" href=\"words/assume.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assume</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"assumption\" href=\"words/assumption.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assumption</a>\nAcceptance: Accept that you don't know what this is, you do not know the shape of the 'problem' and maybe you never will\nActionable: think about and implement things as code, action, etc. so they are not dead and static, but alive, dynamic and part of the stream and fabric of Life.\nAnalysis, Elements: Keep track of that are the element, constituents of the systems at play, in use, and see what kinds of fields they generate. For example the words, sentences in text, the colors of an image, etc.\nAsimov: be as clear and precise as possible. It is not easy, and people underestimate this.\nBase Assumptions: take a step back, zoom out, be honest and try to articulate what your base assumptions are\nChange of Scenery, Environment\nConsilience: everything should be connected and the traversal should be natural\nContinuous Improvement\nCreative language, symbols: just like how locals and natives name different plants and animals based on some traits, so that the names themselves contain these traits, we should not be afraid to invent words, language to define specific Centers, Concepts in order to build new tools for thinking, and to avoid the confusion (conflation?) with existing concepts in the mental landscape/mindscape.\nDoubt, Question, Skepticism: it does not cost you anything to ask questions, have doubts and take skeptical positions.\nEnvironment: inspirational (books, things), comfort, relaxed?, lighting, which room, nature, peace, quiet, no possibility for interruption\nGuiding Principles: contemplate what foundations motivate you\nHolistic approach: not only the product is important but all aspects around it in all dimensions and directions (like this list itself)\nItadakimasu: Japanese be thankful, grateful for the resources, food, energy you use, consume, which passes through you, keeps you alive\nJourney over Destination\nKanban: Japanese Learn from History: at least learn that we don't learn from it!\nLifecycle: everything has a lifecycle, so it is a common pattern that can help with analyzing, understanding, learning\nMeditation: calm, compose yourself, re-center\nMetaphors\nMindset: should try to achieve, strive for the appropriate mindset that best first your current activity, creative, production, inspiration\nMind your Balance\nMinimalism: be conservative with space and energy (for ease of maintenance, storage, access, complexity, utility)\nMottainai: Japanese Multi-media, multi-view: why not provide all functions, views, representations for everything?\nNatural abilities: Tap into the natural abilities of the Person\nNutrition: use different states of nutrition (hunger and fasting are not bad)\nOrganization: better organized, for easier access, manipulation, transformation, communication, storage, backup\nOrigin: study the origin and etymology of things, words, names, concepts, people, etc.\nPattern Break: Mix it up sometimes\nPreservation: constant backup, preservation, conservation\n**Pros and Cons\nRandom: take a chance sometimes\nReview: the relation of everything to everything Rewatch, re-read, etc. periodically, you might learn, find something new, see things in a new, different, better light Save for later: Keep things that you do not understand yet, but feel, have an intuition that will be important or valuable, and might come back to in the future\nStepwise elaboration, levels of scale: all representations should be gradual, zooming in-out should be natural (like this point itself)\nSubconscious: let your mind work on it in the background while you use your consciousness, focus and attention for more immediate matters\nSwitch points of view, perspectives: try as many as you can, contemplate and compare them, understand the differences\nTry different structures: cyclical, linear, tree, branching, networked\nUnfolding: everything should be foldable stepwise, in a natural beautiful way (like Origami), from one point, to complete multidimensional, explorable space\nUse Colors\nUse Language\nUse your circumstances: lean into your gifts, abilities, genetics, knowledge, power, wealth, etc.\nVersion control: know where you left off, see the evolution, try forks Video, Text, Transcript, Audio, Presentation, etc.
